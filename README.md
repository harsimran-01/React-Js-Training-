# React-Js-Training-

🧠 React JS Training Project

Description
This project was built as part of my React JS training and practice journey. It focuses on understanding core React concepts such as components, props, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering.

The project also includes a simple product filtering feature using dropdown menus, demonstrating how React can be used to handle dynamic UI updates.

💡 Technologies Used

HTML – for structuring the web page

CSS – for styling and responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – for dynamic functionality

React JS – for building reusable components and UI logic

Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS (if you’ve used either) – for styling components

🚀 Features

Dynamic product filtering using dropdowns

Reusable React components

Event handling with onClick and state updates

JSX-based UI rendering

Git and terminal usage for project management
